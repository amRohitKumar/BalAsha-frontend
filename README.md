## Understanding of problem
<br>

Bal Asha wants to digitise the entire process from the time an orphaned child enters their purview until they are officially registered/accepted in the government’s CARINGS (Child Adoption Resource Information & Guidance System) adoption network.
The process flow is a series of steps involving collections of various legal documents establishing the child’s identity and registration of the child at several institutions to ensure that either the child is directed back to his biological parents or is registered for adoption.


## UI and functionalities
<br>

The UI of the project has been made in such a manner that simplicity and ease of access is maintained especially for the social worker.
It includes a basic sign in page. The process flow pages are easily categorised based on the type of the case and is directly shown to the social worker. It allows the worker to simply follow the step as suggested to him/her by the platform. A detailed and compact UI has been created for the Manager which allows him to cover all domains of data from past documents of completed cases to new documents of ongoing cases. Additionally,  all collected data has been used for analysis which allows the manager to understand the situation of the case and hence the case can be concluded more meticulously.

The major functionalities included are
1) Easy uploading of all necessary documents by social workers. 
2) Real time monitoring of progress in each case by manager.
3) Detailed history compilation of each completed case for the manager.
4) Allotment of new cases to social workers.
5) Graphs and data analysis which provides better understanding of the case.
6) Notification alerts to social workers for the next task on reaching the deadline.
